description: Operational reference for cloud-agent harnesses (Codex Cloud, Cursor Background Agent) — what each can and can't reach (hex.pm, mix tasks, Tidewave, external HTTP), runtime gotchas (Cursor's Erlang/Elixir paths, asdf shim interception, Credo TODO exit-code-2 expected behavior), self-validation expectations (Cursor should run the harness pre-PR; Codex can't), and the AGENTS.md generation workflow that gives both agents the same instruction set Claude Code uses. Loaded into AGENTS.md via @-import. Sibling of the `agent-dispatch` / `agent-pr-review` delegation skills (the dispatcher / reviewer view).

## Cloud Agent Environments

Operational reference for cloud-agent harnesses (Codex Cloud, Cursor Background Agent). Loaded into AGENTS.md via `@`-import so agents read env-specific runtime details, gotchas, and capability scope before doing work.

For the **reviewer / dispatcher** view (push-back-vs-fix calculus, eligibility markers), see `agent-pr-review.md` § "Push-Back-vs-Fix-Locally Matrix by Agent" and `agent-dispatch.md` § "Delegation Eligibility Filter Order". This file is the **agent's own** env reference.

### Codex Cloud

#### 🚨 Code-mutation delegation SUSPENDED (Elixir projects, 2026-05-05)

**Codex Cloud's Elixir path is broken at the proxy layer, not the runtime layer.** Verified 2026-05-13 with a Symphony Elixir dispatch (sharper than the 2026-05-05 cartouche finding that recorded this as "no runtime"):

- `mise` is present in the image, with **Erlang 27.1.2** and **Elixir 1.18.3-otp-27** pre-installed at `/root/.local/share/mise/installs/{erlang,elixir}/...`. Binaries exist but aren't on default PATH — naive `mix ...` fails `command not found`, which is what produced the original "no runtime" misread.
- Even when you point at the pre-installed binary directly with explicit PATH + `MIX_HOME`, **`mix local.hex` and `mix deps.get` return `hex.pm` 403 Forbidden through the agent-phase proxy**. The Codex Cloud "Common dependencies" allowlist preset covers crates.io / npmjs.com / pypi.org but not hex.pm.
- Repos that pin a newer toolchain via `mise.toml` (e.g. Symphony's Erlang 28 / Elixir 1.19.5-otp-28) hit a second wall: `mise install` can't reach the toolchain assets through the proxy either.

Net effect is the same — Codex can't run any `mix` task, ships zero harness evidence — but the load-bearing fix is hex.pm allowlisting (and ideally putting the mise-installed Elixir on default PATH), not "install Elixir." Until that lands, **`[CX]` code-mutation delegation is suspended** for any Elixir repo. See `task-prioritization.md` § "Codex Delegation (`[CX]`)" for the policy lock; route everything to `[CSR]` (Cursor) in the meantime — Cursor's harness has Elixir/OTP on PATH, hex.pm reachable, and runs the full mix toolchain.

Public ask filed with Symphony team: [openai/symphony#70](https://github.com/openai/symphony/discussions/70) (Q&A discussion, 2026-05-13).

**What's still permitted (no runtime needed):** review-only delegations — see § "Review-only tasks" below. Codex reads PR diffs from the issue body and posts a verdict comment; no `mix` invocation, no compile, no test runner involved. The Codex-Reviews-Cursor pattern (see `agent-dispatch.md` § "Codex Delegation (`[CX]`)") remains usable while the code-mutation suspension is in force, but treat as exception-not-default until the broader env is verified healthy.

#### Constraints (configurable network, no Elixir runtime)

Even setting aside the suspended-delegation policy above, Codex Cloud's env has structural gaps that scope what it can do at all:

- **Elixir runtime present but unreachable.** `mise` ships with Erlang 27.1.2 + Elixir 1.18.3-otp-27 installed at `/root/.local/share/mise/installs/{erlang,elixir}/...`, but not on default PATH (so naive `mix` fails `command not found`). Even with explicit PATH/`MIX_HOME` pointing at the pre-installed binary, **`hex.pm` returns 403 through the proxy** — `mix local.hex` and `mix deps.get` both fail at the registry layer. Repos pinning a newer toolchain via `mise.toml` also can't fetch toolchain assets via `mise install`. Verified 2026-05-05 (initial finding, recorded as "no runtime") and 2026-05-13 (sharpened with Symphony Elixir dispatch transcript). This is the load-bearing reason for the Elixir suspension above; the fix is hex.pm allowlisting, not runtime install.
- **Network access is environment-configurable, not categorically absent.** Per [OpenAI's Codex Cloud docs](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cloud/internet-access), the agent phase defaults to offline, but operators may enable per-environment allowlists. The "Common dependencies" preset reaches **crates.io, npmjs.com, pypi.org, and ~70 dev domains** (source control, vendor docs for the common ecosystems, etc.). **hex.pm is NOT in the common preset** — even with the preset enabled, `mix deps.get` would still fail, which is why this whole section reads "no internet" from the Elixir perspective. For Rust / Python / Node delegations: assume reach to the canonical registry is plausible-but-unverified; try before trusting, and fall back to in-prompt context when blocked. Don't assume RFCs / EIPs / arbitrary vendor docs are reachable unless explicitly allowlisted.
- **No Tidewave.** `mcp__tidewave__project_eval` is not available. Tasks needing live-data diagnosis or runtime-state inspection should not be in scope.
- **HTTP-method restriction (when network IS enabled).** Operators can lock allowlisted domains to `GET` / `HEAD` / `OPTIONS` only; state-changing methods (`POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`) are then blocked. Treat any allowlisted endpoint as read-only unless verified otherwise.

#### What to ship in the PR (when delegation is restored)

When the runtime gap is fixed and `[CX]` code-mutation delegation resumes, Codex PRs may still ship without full local test evidence depending on what's been restored — the local reviewer (via `staged-review:commit-review`) runs the harness Codex couldn't. Make the reviewer's job easier:

- **List acceptance criteria you addressed** in the PR description (one bullet per criterion).
- **Flag uncertainty explicitly** — "I'm assuming `assert_receive/3` here based on training-data recall; please verify against ExUnit's hex docs."
- **Don't fabricate test counts or runtime claims** you can't verify. Past failure mode (2026-05-05): Codex PRs claimed harness runs that the env couldn't actually execute. CI is the only honest signal until the env is verified — see `agent-pr-review.md` § "CI as the Shared Harness".

#### Review-only tasks (review delegation)

When you (Codex Cloud) are assigned an issue whose body opens with `REVIEW-ONLY task. Do NOT open a PR, commit code, or edit files`, the deliverable is a Linear comment — not a PR.

1. The issue body embeds the full PR diff inline under "## PR Diff". Read it from the issue body; you do NOT need `gh pr diff`.
2. Optionally — if `gh` CLI is available in your sandbox — run read-only commands `gh pr view <N> --json reviews,comments`, `gh api repos/<OWNER>/<REPO>/pulls/<N>/comments`, `gh pr checks <N>` for additional context. If `gh` is unavailable, skip this; the embedded diff is sufficient.
3. Post ONE comment on the delegation issue with: verdict line (APPROVED / BLOCKED / DISCUSS), findings table (`file:line | category | severity (1-10) | description`), one paragraph on acceptance-criteria coverage.
4. Transition the issue to Done.
5. Do **not** open a pull request. Do **not** commit code. Do **not** edit any file. Do **not** post review comments on the GitHub PR — verdict goes on the Linear issue only.

**Pilot status (2026-05):** the "no PR" instruction's reliability is unverified. If your harness pushes you toward opening a PR for a review-only issue, **stop and post a Linear comment instead**. Stray review-PRs are a known v1 risk.

### Cursor Cloud

#### Runtime

The Cursor Background Agent Linux env ships with Erlang and Elixir at non-asdf paths. Set PATH explicitly before any mix command:

- **Erlang/OTP 27** — installed at `/usr/local/bin/erl` (prebuilt `.deb` from [benoitc/erlang-dist](https://github.com/benoitc/erlang-dist)).
- **Elixir 1.18.4** — installed at `/usr/local/elixir/bin/`. Add to PATH:

  ```bash
  export PATH="/usr/local/elixir/bin:$PATH"
  ```

- **asdf shim gotcha** — if `asdf` shims are present in PATH (often inherited from `~/.bashrc`), they intercept `erl` and fail with `"No version is set for command erl"`. The Cursor environment-setup script removes them; if the error reappears mid-session, check `~/.bashrc` for asdf entries and restart the shell.

#### Capabilities

Cursor cloud has internet + can run mix tasks (verified in round-trip testing):

- **hex.pm reachable** — third-party hex-package API signatures can be verified directly. The `assert_received` vs `assert_receive` class of bug should not recur on Cursor PRs.
- **Mix tasks runnable** — `mix deps.get`, `mix compile`, `mix test` (and `mix test.json` if `ex_unit_json` is in deps), `mix credo --strict`, `mix format --check-formatted`, `mix dialyzer` (provided the PLT cache builds — first-run cost on a fresh env).
- **General HTTP likely available** — not yet stress-tested against arbitrary external APIs / RFCs / EIPs. Treat as broadly available pending counter-evidence.
- **Tidewave reachable (with setup)** — verified 2026-05-07. The Cursor Background Agent VM can run Tidewave on `localhost:<port>/tidewave/mcp`; agents reach it two ways:
  - **Always works:** raw `curl` to the MCP endpoint with a `tools/call` JSON body. No session-start dependency — usable mid-session even if Tidewave wasn't running at startup.
  - **Native via `CallMcpTool`:** requires Tidewave to be **running before the agent session begins**. Cursor's MCP client caches the initial connection result, so a server started mid-session won't be picked up natively — the agent has to fall back to `curl` for that session. `.cursor/mcp.json` configures the client to point at the MCP URL.

  **Pre-start options** (so `CallMcpTool` works natively): leave `mix tidewave` running in a tmux session from a prior agent run (persists across sessions in the same VM), or bake startup into a VM snapshot. The Cursor environment-setup script can't itself launch Tidewave reliably enough to satisfy "running at session start," because the MCP client probes too early.

#### Tidewave on Cursor — Reach details

```bash
# Direct MCP call (always works once Tidewave is running):
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:4002/tidewave/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/call",
       "params":{"name":"project_eval","arguments":{"code":"1 + 1"}}}'
```

Tools available on Cursor identical to local: `project_eval`, `get_docs`, `get_source_location`, `get_logs`, `search_package_docs`. Port comes from the project's Tidewave registry entry (`~/.claude/tidewave-ports.md`); the `.cursor/mcp.json` URL must match.

**Implication for delegation:** live-data / runtime-state tasks are NOT a Cursor-eligibility blocker the way they used to be. Push-back-vs-fix matrix updates accordingly — see `agent-pr-review.md` § "Push-Back-vs-Fix-Locally Matrix by Agent".

#### Self-validation expectation

**Cursor MUST run the full harness green before opening the PR.** A PR that opens with any harness check failing is a defect, not a draft for review — the local reviewer's job is the 5-category audit + acceptance-criteria cross-reference, *not* triaging mechanical harness failures the agent could have caught itself. A red harness in a Cursor PR is a push-back finding regardless of severity: stop the audit, post a Linear `@cursor` comment naming the failing check, wait for re-push.

**Mandatory pre-PR checklist** (every check must exit clean — exit 0 for tools that don't have content-aware exit codes; for `mix credo` see the TODO/FIXME exit-2 carve-out below):

```bash
mix format --check-formatted     # MUST be clean — no drift on touched files
mix compile --warnings-as-errors # MUST compile with no warnings
mix credo --strict               # MUST be clean (TODO/FIXME exit-2 is the only acceptable non-zero — see Gotchas)
mix sobelow --exit Low           # MUST be clean — security scanner; project's `.sobelow-skips` baseline applies
mix doctor                       # MUST be clean — every public function has @doc + @spec; honors `.doctor.exs` ignore_paths
mix test.json --quiet            # MUST be green — every test passes
mix test.json --cover --cover-threshold N  # MUST meet repo's coverage tier (≥80 standard, ≥95 critical)
mix dialyzer                     # MUST be clean — first-run PLT cost is on Cursor's clock, subsequent runs are cached
```

**Why MUST not SHOULD:** Cursor's env has the runtime to do this work; if the harness fails post-push, every reviewer/CI cycle that catches it is wasted ceremony. Push-back-on-red-harness is the cheapest enforcement loop — Cursor amends, re-pushes, CI re-runs in parallel with whatever else is in flight. The reviewer's audit attention should land on the diff's *substance* (acceptance criteria coverage, design judgment, edge cases the harness can't catch), not on `mix format` complaints.

**For the issue body's acceptance criteria:** see `agent-dispatch.md` § "Code-Only PRs + Required Acceptance Criteria" — every delegated issue carries an explicit "harness green at PR open" bullet, so a failing harness is a blocking acceptance-criterion miss, not a "soft polish" item.

#### Gotchas

- **Credo TODO/FIXME exit code** — Credo flags `TODO:` / `FIXME:` tags as design suggestions and exits with code 2 even when nothing else is wrong. Per `~/.claude/includes/development-philosophy.md` § "TODO Comment Requirements", surfaced TODOs are _tracked debt working as intended_, not regressions. Don't strip them. Treat exit code 2 with only TODO/FIXME findings as expected, not as a blocker.
- **`mix format --check-formatted` on pre-existing drift** — repos that aren't fully formatted may surface format violations on files outside the diff. Only fix drift on files the PR touches (per `critical-rules.md` § "FIX HOOK-FLAGGED ISSUES ON FILES YOU TOUCH"); leave the rest for the repo owner.

#### Linear handle

Cursor's Background Agent has Linear-displayName `cursor` (verified id: `b8668f6b-992f-4152-9e59-13b6fe1f599b`). Reviewers push back via Linear comments with `@cursor` mention; Cursor picks up the mention within ~5 min and amends the PR with a fresh commit, posting confirmation comments back on the issue. **Verified end-to-end** in early Cursor round-trip testing (2026-05): a verbatim code-suggestion push-back was applied surgically, no scope creep. Linear @-mention preferred over GitHub PR comment — keeps the conversation thread on the issue.

### CI as the Shared Harness

When the target repo has a `harness.yml` (see `elixir-ci-harness` skill in `claude-marketplace-elixir`), every PR push runs the full Elixir harness as a GitHub check — visible to user, agent, and PR review tooling. CI was originally pitched as the canonical fix for Codex's hex.pm gap (the harness could verify what Codex's env couldn't), but the 2026-05-05 finding that Codex's env has no Elixir runtime *at all* makes CI a fix-only-on-paper for Codex code-mutation delegation: a PR with no harness-validated commits is one CI green away from the same uncertainty either way. This is one of the reasons code-mutation `[CX]` delegation is currently suspended (§ "Codex Cloud → Code-mutation delegation SUSPENDED"). Cursor's env can run mix tasks but doesn't *guarantee* it pre-PR; CI still enforces the gate uniformly for Cursor PRs and remains the authoritative harness signal.

The shift this enables:

- **Reviewer reads `gh pr checks <n>`** instead of running the full local harness (was 15+ min per PR via local mix; CI runs in parallel with the agent's work and is done by the time the reviewer looks)
- **Push-back becomes the default for harness drift.** When CI flags a format / credo / dialyzer / coverage issue, the reviewer's job is to point the agent at the failing check — not to fix it locally. The cloud agent (Cursor especially, since it has hex.pm + can run mix) iterates against the same CI signal the reviewer sees
- **Local fix shrinks to the env-constraint exception cases.** Per `agent-pr-review.md` § "Push-Back-vs-Fix-Locally Matrix by Agent", local-fix is reserved for items the agent fundamentally can't verify — hex.pm for Codex, Tidewave for Codex (Cursor reaches it via curl), external specs for Codex. CI handles everything else

`staged-review:commit-review` defers to CI status when present (Step 6 reads `gh pr checks` and treats green as the harness-gate signal). When CI is absent, it falls back to running the local harness inline and surfaces a `TODO(setup-ci)` finding pointing at this skill so the next iteration of the PR has CI.

**Adoption path for delegation-target repos without CI:** copy `templates/harness.yml` from the `elixir-ci-harness` skill into the target repo's `.github/workflows/`, customize the four marked points (branch, MIX_ENV, coverage threshold, integration tag), commit. The next PR push gets the harness check.

### AGENTS.md Generation

Both Codex and Cursor read `AGENTS.md` at the repo root if present. Generate it from `CLAUDE.md` so agents see the same instruction set Claude Code does — same hooks-equivalent guardrails, same `@`-imported includes.

#### Canonical generator

`scripts/sync-agents-md.sh` in the `claude-marketplace-elixir` plugin (path: `~/_DATA/code/claude-marketplace-elixir/scripts/sync-agents-md.sh`). Run from inside the target repo:

```bash
bash ~/_DATA/code/claude-marketplace-elixir/scripts/sync-agents-md.sh
```

The script reads `./CLAUDE.md`, resolves `@`-imports (including `~/`), inlines content with `<!-- @-import: ... -->` markers, and writes `./AGENTS.md`. Marker comment at the top reads `<!-- Auto-generated from CLAUDE.md by ... — do not edit manually -->`.

#### Workflow

1. Edit project `CLAUDE.md` (or any `~/.claude/includes/*.md` it imports).
2. Run `sync-agents-md.sh` to regenerate `AGENTS.md`.
3. Commit both files together — they should never drift.

#### When Cursor auto-generates an AGENTS.md PR

Cursor's setup task can autonomously open a PR scaffolding an `AGENTS.md` for its env (observed in round-trip testing). When this happens in a repo that already uses the `sync-agents-md.sh` workflow:

- **Close the auto-generated PR.** The canonical generator is the source of truth.
- **Extract any genuinely useful env-specific bits** (paths, gotchas, runtime quirks) and add them here in this include — so they auto-flow to every repo's AGENTS.md via the standard `@`-import chain.
- Don't merge ad-hoc per-repo `AGENTS.md` content. The whole point of generating from `CLAUDE.md` is single-source consistency across the portfolio.

### Fly Sprite (third target — different shape)

Fly Sprite-hosted Claude Code is a third delegation option that doesn't fit the harness model documented above — it's a raw VM (Ubuntu 25.10 + Fly kernel) with Claude Code 2.1.92 pre-installed in `--dangerously-skip-permissions` mode, full network access, full ext4 persistence backed by JuiceFS + Litestream, and **Elixir/Erlang/Mix pre-installed at `/.sprite/bin/` without an asdf shim layer** — closes the entire class of asdf-PATH gotchas Cursor's env has. Tokens billed against the user's existing Anthropic plan via OAuth (no extra subscription stack). Different shape, different operational concerns (no built-in task ingestion, no completion signal, `claude --print` exit code unreliable). See **`sprite-claude-code.md`** for the CLI surface, auth threading, sleep/wake quirks, and the manual-orchestration loop. Strictly more capable than Codex/Cursor on hex.pm + live-Phoenix-app + dialyzer-memory axes; strictly less polished on auto-task-ingestion + status-loop axes — pick Sprite for env-capability tasks, Cursor for routine self-contained PRs.
