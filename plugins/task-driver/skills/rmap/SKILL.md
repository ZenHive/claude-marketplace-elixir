## rmap — Roadmap Substrate

`rmap` is a single-binary CLI that manages `roadmap/tasks.toml` as the typed source of truth for a project's roadmap, rendering `ROADMAP.md` (human view) and `roadmap/data.json` (agent view) from it. **Every project uses rmap** — `tasks.toml` is canonical, `ROADMAP.md` is generated. Hand-editing task tables in `ROADMAP.md` is legacy; migrate (see below).

This file is the **decision layer** — *which* command, *when*. The authoritative command contract is `rmap --help` / `rmap schema` (the live `tasks.toml` field list, derived from the source) plus rmap's own CI-gated `SKILLS.md` in the rmap repo. Don't hand-maintain a parallel command reference here.

### Project layout

```
<project_root>/
├── ROADMAP.md         # rendered — hand-edited prose outside marker pairs is byte-preserved
└── roadmap/
    ├── tasks.toml     # canonical source — author this
    └── data.json      # generated — agents read it for structured access
```

`rmap` walks ancestors of cwd to find `roadmap/tasks.toml`.

### Command surface, by intent

| Intent | Command |
|---|---|
| Read one task / many | `rmap show <id> [--json]` · `rmap list --status\|--phase\|--marker\|--bundle\|--milestone\|--delivered-by [--json]` |
| Pick the next task | `rmap next [--marker M] [--bundle B] [--milestone V] [--count N] [--json]` |
| Pick a session-sized bundle | `rmap next-bundle [--json]` · `rmap bundles` to discover them |
| Pick the parallel-safe dispatch set | `rmap ready [--bundle B] [--phase N] [--marker M] [--milestone V] [--count N] [--dispatchable] [--fields a,b,c] [--json]` |
| List release lines / pin to a release | `rmap milestones [--has-next\|--status\|--json]` · `rmap milestone <id> <name\|none>` |
| Change status | `rmap status <id> <pending\|in_progress\|blocked\|done\|superseded> [--implemented "..."] [--delivered-by <agent>] [--verified] [--shipped-in <sha>] [--reason "..."]` (bulk `1,2,3` atomic; `done` requires `implemented`; outcome flags settable only on `done`; `--reason` settable only on `blocked`) |
| Toggle a marker | `rmap mark <id> +parallel -cx` |
| Add a dependency | `rmap depend <id> on <id>` |
| Create task(s) | `rmap new --from-stdin` (TOML on stdin, atomic batch, full field set per `rmap schema`) — see `task-writing.md`. Interactive `rmap new` covers the common subset; reach for `--from-stdin` when interactive doesn't prompt for a field you need. |
| Format a task as a cloud-agent prompt | `rmap delegate <id> --to claude\|codex\|cursor` |
| Migrate a hand-edited ROADMAP.md | `rmap import` |
| See what changed vs a git ref | `rmap diff [--verbose] [--json]` |
| Health signals (soft, always exit 0) | `rmap doctor [--json]` |
| Strict gates (pre-commit / CI) | `rmap validate` · `rmap validate --check-render` |
| Render after editing tasks.toml directly | `rmap render` (or `rmap watch` for live re-render) |

All mutators **validate-then-write**: an invalid mutation leaves `tasks.toml` byte-equal to its prior state. `--json` envelopes on the read commands are append-only stable surfaces.

### rmap is cheap — set and complete inline; don't manufacture a session

A task's *existence in rmap* is decoupled from *how it gets executed*. Creating one
(`rmap new`) and completing it (`rmap status <id> done`) are lightweight ledger
writes — seconds, a handful of tokens. Neither warrants a separate session, a
dispatch, or a round of "should this even be a task?" deliberation.

When a task is small and you're already in the relevant code, the cheapest correct
path is: **do it inline now, then `rmap status <id> done --implemented "…"` in the same
motion.** Reserve a separate dispatched/cloud-agent session for work that genuinely
earns it — large, risky, parallelizable, or (under a dogfooding mandate) a change to
the orchestrator's own surface. Capturing a discovery as a *pending* task is also fine
and cheap — but **capture ≠ dispatch, and a task ≠ a session.** Hand-done inline tasks
honestly leave `verified` unset (no independent grader ran).

**Failure mode this kills:** treating every rmap entry as a dispatch-and-verify cycle,
or looping in discussion over whether to file/dispatch, when setting + doing +
marking-done inline costs less than the deliberation. Set it, do it (or defer it),
mark it done — don't burn time, tokens, and circles on the ceremony around it.

### Batches are derived, not declared

`rmap next-bundle` returns a session-sized **bundle** — a set of related pending tasks. A *batch* is a finer-grained slice of that bundle: the executor groups bundle tasks by `depends_on` into successive layers of disjoint work (per `workflow-philosophy.md` § "Batched Execution"). There is no `rmap batch` command — batch derivation is the executor's job, not the source-of-truth's. Hierarchy: phase ⊇ bundle ⊇ batch ⊇ task.

### Parallel-dispatch surface (`rmap ready` + the orchestration fields)

When you need *the set of tasks I can dispatch in parallel right now* — not "a session's worth" (`next-bundle`) and not "the single best" (`next`) — use **`rmap ready`**. It returns every `pending` task whose deps are all `done`, which is **mutually independent by construction** (a pending task with all deps done can't depend on another pending task), so the whole set is safe to fan out at once. `rmap ready --bundle <B>` is the dispatchable layer-0 of a bundle — the parallel batch `next-bundle`'s serial chain can't express. Four facts the orchestrator reads instead of re-parsing every task body:

- **`dep_layer`** (computed, on every `--json`): longest-path depth over the in-repo dep graph. Within a result set the lowest `dep_layer` present is the current parallel wave; higher layers are later waves — makes `next-bundle`'s topo chain self-describing.
- **`handbuild` marker + `--dispatchable`**: `--dispatchable` (on `ready` / `list`) drops `handbuild`-marked tasks (human-driven-browser work). Mark the minority exception; everything else is headless-dispatchable by default.
- **`touches`** (creation-time field): the broader *involvement hint* — files a task may read or write, typically a superset of `files_to_modify` (the write target). Consumer collision rule (you dedupe; rmap doesn't enforce): two tasks conflict iff `(touches(A) ∪ files_to_modify(A)) ∩ (touches(B) ∪ files_to_modify(B)) ≠ ∅`. Unioning both fields keeps `files_to_modify` respected even when a task's `touches` isn't a perfect superset — `touches` is "typically," not guaranteed, a superset. Set it via `rmap new --from-stdin`.
- **`--fields a,b,c`** (on `ready` / `list`): projects `--json` to a bare array of just the named keys per task — token-cheap for an orchestrator that only needs `id,status,eff,depends_on,dep_layer,touches`. Implies `--json`; unknown name exits 1.

### D/B/U mapping

rmap's scoring **is** the `task-prioritization.md` framework, executable:

- `scores = { d, b, u }` on each `[[task]]` ⇒ the `[D:X/B:Y/U:Z]` you'd otherwise hand-write
- `eff = (b + u) / (2 × d)`, computed at read time, never stored — same formula, same tiers (`≥2.0 🎯 / ≥1.5 🚀 / ≥1.0 📋 / else ⚠️`)
- `scored_at` older than 30 days renders an `Eff:W?` decay suffix

Set scores in `tasks.toml` (via `rmap new` or editing the file); never hand-format the bracket — `rmap render` produces it.

### Status & marker vocabulary

- **status:** `pending | in_progress | blocked | done | superseded` — transitions go through `rmap status`. `blocked` requires a `blocked_reason` (set inline via `--reason "..."`; free-text, blocked-only, overwrites, and **auto-cleared when the task leaves the blocked state** — it renders inline on the blocked row in `ROADMAP.md`); `done` requires `implemented` (set inline via `--implemented "..."`, or pre-populated in `tasks.toml`; on a TTY without the flag, `rmap status` prompts). For bulk `rmap status 1,2,3 done`: the mutation is atomic — if any task is missing `implemented` AND no `--implemented` flag is given AND we're not on a TTY, the whole batch is rejected; `--implemented "..."` applies the same string to every task in the batch.
- **markers:** `parallel | cx | csr | bug | security | docs | handbuild` — `parallel` is the old `[P]`; `cx` / `csr` are the Codex / Cursor delegation markers; `handbuild` flags human-driven-browser work (LiveView/UI/DOM) that `rmap ready --dispatchable` / `rmap list --dispatchable` exclude.
- **milestone status:** `pending | active | done` — distinct vocabulary from task status. Flip by hand-editing `[milestones.<name>].status` (no mutator yet); `active` milestones sort first in `rmap milestones` and are the load-bearing affordance for the "what release am I cutting next?" query.

### Milestones — first-class release lines

`[milestones.<name>]` is a fourth top-level concept alongside phases / bundles / markers. **Phase** orders work, **bundle** groups topically, **markers** modify execution, **milestone** pins a task to a release line. Milestones cross phases by design: a `v1.0` cut typically pulls from several phases.

**Milestone `description` MUST state a hypothesis.** One sentence naming what the milestone tests (e.g., *"proves Bali professionals will pay for a Bali-specific material-price tool"*, not *"data platform complete"*). Feature-checklist descriptions break the Pre-Creation Gate's milestone-fit check (`task-writing.md` § 4): without a hypothesis, no pinned task can be classified as "tests hypothesis" vs "assumes hypothesis, builds on top", and heavy moat-building drifts onto early validation milestones.

**Default at session start: pick the next task via the active milestone.** Keep exactly one milestone at `status = "active"` (the MVP/release you're cutting); plain `rmap next` then auto-biases to it — no `--milestone` flag needed. Reach for `rmap next --milestone <name>` only to override to a different release line.

- Author the table in `tasks.toml`: `[milestones.v0_1] name = "..." order = N status = "active" target_version = "0.1.0"`. `target_version` is optional free-text.
- Pin a task: `rmap milestone <id> v0_1` (or set `milestone = "v0_1"` directly). Unpin: `rmap milestone <id> none`. One milestone per task.
- Discovery: `rmap milestones` (table view with done/total counts + next-task glyph + active-first sort); `rmap milestones --json` for the agent envelope.
- Drive a release line: `rmap next --milestone v0_1` returns the next pending task in that release; composes with `--bundle`, `--phase`, `--marker`. Without an explicit `--milestone`, `rmap next` automatically biases toward tasks pinned to any `active` milestone — analogous to the existing focus-phase bias. **Focus phase dominates** milestone when the two diverge (4-tier lexicographic: focus-only > active-milestone-only); pass `--milestone <name>` to override the auto-bias to a different release.
- `rmap delegate` surfaces the milestone in `## Context` as `- Milestone: v0_1 (target=0.1.0)` so the target agent knows which release ships their work.
- `rmap render` adds a conditional `🚀 **<milestone>** ·` segment to the task row in `ROADMAP.md` — rows without a milestone render byte-identically to before.

### `body` vs `implemented`

- `body` = original task definition / intent (never mutated after creation — the spec at scoping time).
- `implemented` = what was actually built and why (required when `status = "done"`; `rmap show` renders both side-by-side as `body (original intent):` / `implemented (what shipped):` when present together). For trivial tasks where delivery matched the spec, `implemented = "as specified in body"` is honest and durable.

### Outcome layer: `delivered_by` + `verified` + `shipped_in`

Three optional transition-time fields next to `implemented`, all set by `rmap status <id> done`. The triple answers who built it, whether a grader agreed, and where it landed:

- `delivered_by = "<agent>"` — which agent or instance actually shipped the task (free-text, unvalidated, like `model`). Answers "who built this?" as a queryable fact without parsing prose. Settable via `--delivered-by <agent>` on `done` transitions; overwrites on re-set.
- `verified = true` — independent evaluator confirmed the task. Two-state: `true` = a check separate from the implementer passed (verification stack green, code-review approved); absent = not yet graded (hand-built, bootstrap, merged directly). Settable via `--verified` presence flag on `done`; to clear, edit `tasks.toml` directly. Encodes evaluator-separation as a fact, not as a status — `done` means "an implementer said so", `verified` means "a grader agreed".
- `shipped_in = "<sha>"` — where the work landed (commit SHA / PR ref, free-text, unvalidated). Settable via `--shipped-in <sha>` on `done` transitions; overwrites on re-set. No sha-shape validation, no git auto-derivation — the caller supplies it.

All three surface in `rmap show`, `rmap list` JSON / `data.json` (via `ExportedTask`), and `rmap diff --verbose`. `rmap list --delivered-by <agent>` filters the roadmap into a per-agent delivery ledger (status-agnostic — matches the field, not just done tasks). `rmap doctor` emits a soft `ClaimedNotGraded` advisory for `done && verified.is_none()` ("claimed, not graded") — always exit 0, hand-built tasks are legitimate. All three stay off `StdinTask` / `NewTaskFields` on purpose; they are outcome facts, not creation-time intent.

### Pinning an LLM model per task

`model = "<model-id>"` on a `[[task]]` records which LLM should do the work — free-text, unvalidated (model IDs churn). `rmap delegate` surfaces it as a `- Model:` bullet in the prompt's `## Context` so the target agent knows which model to run. Settable at creation via `rmap new` (interactive + `--from-stdin`) or a direct edit. Distinct from `assignee` (who owns it) and `rmap delegate --to` (which agent *environment*).

### Migrating a hand-edited ROADMAP.md

Run `rmap import` — it emits a paste-ready prompt that walks an agent through converting one or more hand-edited `ROADMAP.md` files into `roadmap/tasks.toml` (schema, marker pairs, validate → render → diff-check). One-time, LLM-driven; the prompt carries the detail so this include doesn't have to.
