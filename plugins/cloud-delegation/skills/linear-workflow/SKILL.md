## Linear-as-Queue Workflow

Cross-repo issue tracking via Linear MCP, primarily for **cloud-agent delegation** (Codex, Cursor, others as the lineup grows) and **multi-repo coordination**. The shape is generic — any repo can adopt it. Workspace specifics (team key, project IDs, repo↔project mapping) belong in a separate workspace include or per-repo CLAUDE.md, **not here**.

### When to Adopt

> **Scope note.** Linear's first-party `@Linear` agent (Settings → AI) is a separate system. This file covers third-party cloud agents (Cursor, Codex, similar) that appear as Linear users assignable via the `delegate` field on issues.

Use Linear-as-queue when:

- **Cloud-agent delegation is in active use.** `[CX]` / `[CSR]` tasks need a queue the agent can poll; ROADMAP.md alone isn't pollable.
- **Work spans 2+ repos.** "Library release → downstream-app bump" deserves linked issues.
- **Issue state must survive across Claude sessions and the IDE.** Linear's UI/Slack/email integrations beat ROADMAP.md for staying top-of-mind.

Don't adopt when single-repo with a clean ROADMAP.md is doing the job, no cloud-agent delegation is in flight, or the work fits in a TodoWrite session.

### MCP Registration

Linear is one workspace per user — register at **user scope**:

```bash
claude mcp add --scope user --transport http linear-server https://mcp.linear.app/mcp
```

| Scope | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `user` (recommended) | Available in every session. Single registration. |
| `local` (per-project) | Only that project sees it. |
| `project` (`.mcp.json`) | Avoid — `.mcp.json` is checked-in and shared with collaborators who may not have Linear access. |

**Tidewave parallel:** Tidewave is per-project (unique port → `.mcp.json`). Linear is one workspace serving all repos → user-scope is right; don't reflexively copy the Tidewave pattern.

Verify with `claude mcp list`. Restart Claude Code after registration if tools don't appear.

### Workspace Shape

Hierarchy: **Workspace → Teams → Projects → Issues** (+ optional Cycles, Milestones, Initiatives).

- **One team per workspace** for personal portfolios. Teams matter when multiple humans need separate workflows.
- **One project per repo.** Clean `project: <repo>` filter on every `save_issue`. Cross-repo work uses `relatedTo` between issues.
- **Workspace-wide labels** — queue selectors that `staged-review:commit-review` and the agents themselves filter on:
  - `cx-eligible` — Codex-eligible
  - `cursor-eligible` — Cursor-eligible (broader; hex.pm + mix tasks reachable)
  - Generic: `Bug`, `Feature`, etc.
- **Status flow** (default Linear team workflow): `Backlog` → `Todo` → `In Progress` → `In Review` → `Done` (plus `Canceled`, `Duplicate`).

**Alternative** (one mega-project + repo-tagged labels): only when project-create permissions are restricted. Cross-repo `relatedTo` story is harder; project-level filtering breaks down. Escape hatch only.

#### Repo selector for multi-repo workspaces

When one Linear workspace serves multiple cloud-agent-targeted repos, Cursor needs an explicit signal which on-disk repo to clone. Cursor's documented selector priority (cursor.com/docs/integrations/linear):

1. `[repo=owner/repository]` syntax in the issue body or any later comment
2. Issue-scope labels matching `<org>/<repo>` against connected GitHub repos
3. Project-scope labels matching the same pattern
4. Cursor dashboard default repo

**Recommended pattern:** workspace-wide label group `repo` with one child label per repo, attached at issue scope.

- Create a workspace label group named `repo` once (Linear UI → Workspace settings → Labels → New group). Add one child label per connected GitHub repo, named `<org>/<repo>` exactly.
- **Per-repo onboarding** (one-time, before the first delegated issue):
  1. Verify: `mcp__linear-server__list_issue_labels(name: "<org>/<repo>")`.
  2. If missing: `mcp__linear-server__create_issue_label(name: "<org>/<repo>", parent: "repo")`. Omit `teamId` for workspace scope.
  3. Record the returned label id in the workspace-specific include's "Repo Selector Labels" table.
- On every delegated issue, attach `cursor-eligible` (or `cx-eligible`) AND the matching `<org>/<repo>` label.

**Silent-drop failure mode.** If `<org>/<repo>` doesn't exist, `save_issue` accepts the name and silently drops it from the response. Cursor then falls back to its dashboard-default repo (silent miscluster). Recovery: cancel-and-refile after running the onboarding step.

**Known gap:** project-scope label attachment via MCP doesn't currently persist — route via issue-scope labels only; the body-syntax `[repo=owner/repository]` is the documented escape hatch.

### Codex Delegation (`[CX]`)

> **🚨 Suspended (Elixir projects, 2026-05-05).** Codex Cloud has no Elixir runtime; tier-2 review-only `[CX]` is also disabled (polling-race failure mode; bot ensemble already covers correctness). Do not create new `[CX]` issues of either flavor — route to `[CSR]` (Cursor). See `cloud-agent-environments.md` § "Codex Cloud → Code-mutation delegation SUSPENDED" for the path back. Criteria below describe what `[CX]` *would* mean if/when delegation resumes.

**When restored:** flow mirrors the Cursor Delegation Flow below — `team` / `project` / `labels: ["cx-eligible", "<org>/<repo>"]` / `delegate: "Codex"` / status `Todo` / body-as-prompt. Local Claude invokes `staged-review:commit-review`; **user merges** (see `delegation-rules.md` § "DON'T AUTO-MERGE PRS").

**Marker semantics.** Mark ROADMAP tasks suitable for Codex delegation with `[CX]`. **Default: tasks meeting all criteria are `[CX]` unless there's a stated reason otherwise.** Claude's bias is to grab work; this default is a counterweight.

**Criteria (all must be true):**

- Self-contained — single module or feature, no orchestration with other in-flight work
- No Tidewave / live-data exploration required (Codex has no internet)
- No hex-docs lookup required for niche or version-pinned APIs (Codex has no hex.pm)
- No dependency changes (`mix.exs`, lockfile)
- No `.mcp.json`, hooks, or CI changes
- Spec is fully captured in the Linear issue body — no live clarifications mid-flight

ROADMAP row examples:

```
| Task 80 `[CX]` | ⬜              | Delegate to Codex                  |
| Task 81 `[CX]` | 🔄 in-review   | Codex PR open, awaiting review     |
```

### Cursor Delegation Flow

Same shape as the Codex flow with **broader eligibility** — Cursor's cloud env reaches hex.pm and runs `mix` tasks (see § "Cloud Agent Environments").

1. **Create issue** with `team`, `project: <repo>`, `labels: ["cursor-eligible", "<org>/<repo>"]` (skip the second label in single-repo workspaces), `delegate: "Cursor"`, **body = the prompt** (Context / Task / Acceptance criteria / Out of scope / File paths / Scoring / Reviewer note), initial status `Todo`.

   `assignee` and `delegate` are independent fields — an issue can have a human assignee AND a cloud-agent delegate simultaneously. Cursor and Codex watch `delegate`; pickup does not require the agent to also be assignee.

2. **Cursor picks it up.** Background Agent transitions `Todo` → `In Progress`, opens a non-draft PR, transitions to `In Review`. *Observed:* status often stays at `In Progress` — partial-transition failure mode. Don't rely on `In Review` as the readiness signal; PR attachment is authoritative (§ "Polling for 'Ready for Review'"). **Canonical fix:** § "Status Transitions". **Required:** Cursor's `gh pr create` should NOT use `--draft` — the AI-Guidance "PR opened non-draft → In Review" rule (§ "Status Transitions") only fires for non-draft PRs. State this in the issue body's `## Reviewer note`.

3. **Cursor self-validates** — `mix test.json --quiet`, `mix credo --strict`, `mix format --check-formatted`, targeted `mix test test/...`. PRs ship harness-green from Cursor's side. Local `commit-review`'s job is the 5-category audit + acceptance-criteria cross-reference, not "did the harness pass."

4. **Push back via Linear comment with `@cursor` mention.** Cursor picks up `@cursor` mentions within ~5 min, amends the PR with a fresh commit, posts confirmation, reruns the harness. See § "Wake-Mention Discipline" for placement rules.

5. **User merges.** Verdict is informational — see `delegation-rules.md` § "DON'T AUTO-MERGE PRS".

### Wake-Mention Discipline

`@cursor` (and `@codex`, future cloud-agent display names) is a **wake/summon signal, not a tag**. Within ~5 min of an `@cursor` mention on a Linear comment, Cursor's Background Agent picks it up as a fresh push-back and runs a session — including issues already in `Done`. Three hard rules:

1. **Never use `@cursor` on a "stop," "FYI," or closing-out comment.** Posting `@cursor — task is complete; please don't spawn further sessions` literally summons the session you're trying to prevent. For closing-out / informational mentions, write `Cursor:` or `Cursor —` in plain prose. Reserve `@cursor` for **fix-this-now push-back**.

2. **One wake mention per push-back round, not one per surface.** When pushing back across both surfaces (GitHub PR review for line-level, Linear comment for scope/intent), the wake mention goes on **exactly one**. Two `@cursor` mentions in the ~5min pickup window risks double-summons.

3. **Decide BEFORE posting either surface.** If `@cursor` placement is genuinely ambiguous, ask the user before the first surface goes up. Posting one with `@cursor` and asking afterwards has already burned the wake signal. Same shape for `@codex`.

**Where to place the one mention.** Linear `@cursor` is the verified wake channel — prefer it. The GitHub PR review is the **content**, not the wake signal — post line-level findings without `@cursor` if the Linear comment carries the mention. Cleanest single-surface shape: skip the GitHub review, put line-level findings + scope paragraph inline in **one** Linear `@cursor` comment with verbatim code blocks.

**Recovery.** If you slip and post a wake-mention in a stop-intent comment, edit-update via `mcp__linear-server__save_comment` with the comment `id` to replace the body — fast edit beats most polls.

### Review Tiering: When Full Tier 2 Earns Its Cost

`staged-review:commit-review` is expensive. Running it uniformly on every cloud-agent PR over-applies the cost.

**Bots cover the correctness layer.** CodeRabbit, Copilot, and Codex's GitHub bot (3-bot ensemble) catch substantive code-correctness defects at critical tier — wrong arg shapes, missing nil-handling, panic-table swaps. Codex's bot specifically does evidence-based fact-checking with permalinks.

**Local Tier 2's unique value at critical tier is NOT second-line code review.** It's the orchestration layer above the bots:

1. **Triage** — turn CodeRabbit "consider this" into a verbatim push-back patch with `@cursor`; defer out-of-scope bot findings instead of letting them dilute push-back.
2. **Project-specific rule enforcement** — `.sobelow-skips` regen, `TODO(Task N):` markers, ROADMAP/CHANGELOG acceptance bullets, `harness.yml` conventions.
3. **Procedural orchestration** — merge-conflict surfacing, duplicate-PR closure, CI-red triage, status transitions, push-back-vs-fix routing.
4. **Deep diagnosis** — test-isolation failures, GenServer state pollution, runtime/compile-time interaction bugs that require reading beyond the diff.

If you're re-finding what CodeRabbit already flagged, you're duplicating bot work — pivot to the four roles above.

| Tier | What it covers | Action |
|---|---|---|
| **Critical** | signing, transaction encoding/decoding, ABI codec, RPC client, KMS, anything in the ≥95% coverage tier per `critical-rules.md` § "RAISE COVERAGE BEFORE MUTATING" | Full Tier 2 — role-shifted to triage + project rules + orchestration + diagnosis, not redundant correctness review |
| **Standard** | type/spec fixes, doc updates, coverage pushes, generator changes, test additions, refactors outside the critical-tier list | `gh pr checks <n>`. If green AND bot reviews clean: merge. If any bot flagged something: 5-min skim. No full Tier 2. |
| **Ceremony** | close-out PRs, AGENTS.md tweaks, README-only changes, ROADMAP/CHANGELOG-only updates | CI-green check. Merge. No skim. |

**Touched-files semantic > LOC count.** A 50-LOC change in `lib/<app>/signer/` is critical; a 200-LOC docs change is ceremony.

The push-back-vs-fix matrix below applies to Tier-2 reviews only. Standard/ceremony PRs don't engage the calculus — they merge or fail CI.

For batches of 2+ open cloud-agent PRs, § "Merge-Train Mode (`flow-review`)" applies this tier matrix automatically.

### Cloud Agent Environments

For agent envs (hex.pm, mix tasks, Tidewave, external HTTP availability per agent), see `cloud-agent-environments.md`. Eligibility recap: `[CX]` is code-mutation suspended; `[CSR]` covers hex.pm verification, mix-task validation, third-party API correctness, AND Tidewave / live-runtime tasks (Tidewave reachable on Cursor via `curl localhost:<port>/tidewave/mcp` — verified 2026-05-07; native `CallMcpTool` requires pre-session start).

#### Push-Back-vs-Fix-Locally Matrix by Agent

**Default flow is review-only.** Read the diff via `gh pr view`, `gh pr diff`, `gh api repos/.../pulls/<n>/comments`. Don't spin up a worktree or `gh pr checkout` unless the finding lands in a fix-locally row OR CI is absent — branch checkout silently biases toward "I'll amend this." CI is the shared error gate: every push to a cloud-agent's branch triggers `harness.yml`, so push-back → agent re-pushes → CI runs → green = ready / red = next round. The matrix below is the exception list — local fix is reserved for env-constraint cases the agent fundamentally can't verify.

| Bug class | Codex action | Cursor action |
|---|---|---|
| User-code logic / project-internal API misuse | Push back | Push back |
| Hex-package API correctness (third-party signatures) | **Fix locally** — Codex has no hex.pm | **Push back** — Cursor has hex.pm |
| Test failure / coverage gap on new code | Push back (best Codex can do without `mix test`) | **Push back** — Cursor runs `mix test` |
| Coverage gap on legacy code surfaced by the PR | **Fix locally** — pre-existing debt | **Fix locally** — same |
| Live-data / runtime-state — verification only | **Push back with Tidewave evidence** (Codex has no Tidewave) | **Push back** — Cursor can run Tidewave via `curl` (or `CallMcpTool` if pre-started) |
| Live-data / runtime-state — fix needs verifier's runtime | **Fix locally** (paste-as-comment if viable) | **Push back** if Cursor can verify in its own VM; **fix locally** only if local-only state (your IEx, your DB) is required |
| External spec / RFC / EIP correctness | **Fix locally** — Codex has no external HTTP | Push back (Cursor likely has HTTP) |
| Acceptance criteria not met | Push back | Push back |

**Tidewave is verification, not necessarily fix.** Local Claude has `mcp__tidewave__project_eval` and live runtime/database access. Cursor can also reach Tidewave from its VM (curl-to-MCP always; `CallMcpTool` if pre-started — see `cloud-agent-environments.md` § "Tidewave on Cursor — Reach details"); Codex cannot. Open IEx in the host project (NOT a PR worktree — Tidewave runs against host's currently-loaded code), run `project_eval` against the suspected case, paste the result into the push-back comment as evidence. The asymmetry is a **push-back strengthener**, not a fix-locally trigger — fix-locally only when the code fix is too large to paste verbatim or needs generated artifacts.

> ```
> @cursor verified failure case via Tidewave:
>
> iex> Acme.Users.process(%{user_id: nil})
> ** (FunctionClauseError) no function clause matching in Acme.Users.process/1
>
> Please add a nil guard or update the spec to exclude nil. Re-pushing should green CI.
> ```

**Preferred channel for fix-locally-required findings: paste-as-`@cursor`-comment.**

When a finding lands in a fix-locally row, paste the fix as a Linear `@cursor` (or `@codex`) comment with a verbatim code block:

> ```
> @cursor please apply verbatim and re-push:
>
> ```elixir
> # exact code block here, with file:line context above
> ```
>
> Verified against [link to hex docs / RFC / Tidewave query result].
> ```

The agent applies, re-pushes, CI verifies. Authorship preserved. Single error gate.

**Fallback:** separate branch off the PR's base commit — only when the fix is too large to paste verbatim or needs generated artifacts.

**Never amend the agent's branch.** See `delegation-rules.md` § "NEVER PUSH TO A CLOUD-AGENT'S BRANCH".

**Hybrid is fine:** a PR may have both push-back and fix-locally blockers. Surface as two groups; user decides.

### Fetch Existing Comments Before Auditing

**Before any cloud-agent PR audit, fetch existing comments from BOTH the GitHub PR and the Linear issue.**

GitHub PR — Copilot, CodeRabbit, Codex's GitHub bot, human reviewers:

```bash
gh pr view <number> --json reviews,comments        # PR-level + issue-style
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/<number>/comments    # line-level review comments
```

Linear issue — delegating user's clarifications, scope adjustments, prior-reviewer notes, agent's PR-open summary, prior `@codex` / `@cursor` push-back exchanges:

```
mcp__linear-server__list_comments   # filter by issueId
mcp__linear-server__get_issue       # also returns the comment thread
```

Use both to **skip** issues already flagged, **cross-reference** with own findings, **defer to** existing reviewers when something is intentional, **detect scope drift** (Linear comment usually wins over original issue body), **track push-back round-trips**.

Bot caveats: Copilot can fabricate verbatim diff citations (verify before acting); Codex's GitHub bot does evidence-based fact-checking with permalinks.

### Status Transitions

Three transitions in the delegated-PR lifecycle. Each has **one** owning mechanism — they're complementary, not overlapping.

| Transition | Mechanism | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Todo → In Progress` (agent picks up) | Linear AI Guidance | No GH event to hook — only the agent can drive this |
| `In Progress → In Review` (PR opened non-draft) | Linear AI Guidance | Drafts excluded — see undraft path below |
| `In Review → Done` (PR merged to default) | Native Linear GH workflow rule | Hooked to the GitHub merge event |

**Why two mechanisms.** Agent-driven (Linear AI Guidance) covers transitions that happen before a hookable GitHub event or depend on the agent's own state. GH-integration-driven workflow rules cover transitions hooked to definitive GitHub events (merge is the canonical case).

**Linear AI Guidance setup** (Settings → AI → Guidance, workspace or team scope):

> "When you pick up a Linear issue, transition its status to **In Progress**. When you open a non-draft pull request linked to a Linear issue, transition that issue's status to **In Review**. Do not flip status on PR close or merge — the GitHub integration handles the merge → Done transition."

Cursor (and any other agent reading workspace guidance) picks this up. Codex's behavior here is less verified; treat as best-effort until observed.

**Native GH workflow rule setup** (one-time, workspace admin):

1. Linear → **Workspace settings → Integrations → GitHub** → confirm the org is connected.
2. Linear → **Workspace settings → Workflow** (or Team-scoped) → enable: **PR merged to default branch** on a branch tied to an issue → status `Done`.
3. Verify with a test PR on a branch named `INE-N-…`.

**Drafts.** The "PR opened non-draft → In Review" guidance excludes drafts. If agents open PRs with `gh pr create --draft`, the transition doesn't fire until undrafted. Two complementary fixes:

- Agents stop opening drafts (set in issue body's `## Reviewer note`; Cursor Delegation Flow Step 2).
- `commit-review` Step 4 auto-undrafts via `gh pr ready` when CI is green AND the PR is still draft.

**Polling as safety net.** Both mechanisms can fail to fire (agent didn't read guidance; GH event arrived during a Linear outage). § "Polling for 'Ready for Review'" treats the PR attachment as the authoritative signal — agnostic to status — and is the safety net for both.

### Polling for "Ready for Review"

**The PR attachment is the authoritative signal, not the issue status.** Linear's status field is a cached version of "agent opened a PR" — neither Codex nor Cursor write the cache reliably.

```
filter:
  delegate ∈ { Codex, Cursor }
  status ∈ { In Review, In Progress }
then:
  filter to issues with at least one open GitHub PR attachment
  (via mcp__linear-server__get_issue → attachments[].url)
```

Group results into:

- **`In Review` (canonical):** the agent's transition fired correctly
- **`In Progress` with open PR (non-canonical):** agent opened the PR but didn't flip — surface explicitly so the reviewer/user can flip after review

This is the polling shape `staged-review:commit-review` Step 2 uses. For batch processing of N≥2 PRs, see § "Merge-Train Mode (`flow-review`)".

### Cross-Repo Coordination

- Use `relatedTo` on `save_issue` to link issues across projects. Loose coupling — "these are about the same thing."
- Use `blocks` / `blockedBy` for hard ordering — "library release blocks downstream-app bump."
- **Don't** pile cross-repo work into one issue. Each repo owns its own PR; one issue per repo keeps PR review surface aligned with repo boundaries.

If cross-repo coordination becomes regular (3+ linked issues per month), promote to a Linear **Initiative** as a grouping overlay.

### Merge-Train Mode (`flow-review`)

**Invocation.** Workflow-only — no CLI, no skill wrapper. Triggered by user request ("run flow-review") or in-session decision once 2+ cloud-agent PRs are open in the current repo. The bottleneck it solves: each merge advances the default branch and invalidates every other PR's base SHA, so per-PR rebase round-trips surface phantom conflicts in untouched files. With 3+ PRs queued, rebase tax exceeds review time.

**What `flow-review` does.**

1. **Polls** all open cloud-agent PRs in the current repo (filter from § "Polling for 'Ready for Review'", scoped to current repo + extended to include `mergeStateStatus`).
2. **Classifies** each PR by tier (per § "Review Tiering") and mergeability (CI green | red | conflicting | bot-flagged).
3. **Dependency-sorts** the queue from a directed graph built on file-overlap (parsed from `## Files to modify` of each PR's source issue) + Linear `blockedBy` / `relatedTo`. PRs touching only their own files merge first; coordination-file PRs last. Sort by PR age within each layer.
4. **Surfaces** the ordered queue with per-PR action recommendations.
5. **Executes** the rebase cascade between merges. User owns merges; reviewer owns rebases.

**Tier-based action matrix:**

| Tier | CI | Bots | Conflicts | Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Ceremony | green | clean | none | Surface as "ready, awaiting `gh pr merge`" — user merges, cascade fires |
| Standard | green | clean | none | Same as ceremony, plus 5-min skim if any bot finding |
| Critical | green | clean | none | Hand off to `staged-review:commit-review` (single-PR Tier 2), back to queue |
| Any | red | — | — | Surface for human triage; skip in current pass |
| Any | — | — | conflicting/behind | Trigger rebase cascade (below) |
| Any | — | flagged | — | Surface bot finding for triage (push-back vs. defer) |

**Rebase cascade.** After the user runs `gh pr merge` on PR #N:

```
for each remaining PR in dependency order:
  if PR.mergeStateStatus ∈ { BEHIND, DIRTY }:
    git fetch && git checkout <agent-branch>
    git rebase origin/<default-branch>
    if conflicts:
      attempt mechanical resolution (see invariants)
      if mechanical resolution succeeds:
        git push --force-with-lease
      else:
        git rebase --abort
        post Linear @cursor / @codex comment with conflict context
        skip this PR (agent picks up the rebase)
    else:
      git push --force-with-lease
    wait for CI re-run; loop
```

**Rebase-only carve-out invariants.** Authorized by `delegation-rules.md` § "NEVER PUSH TO A CLOUD-AGENT'S BRANCH" → "Rebase-only carve-out (merge-train mode)". Strict; do not relax.

- **Allowed:** `git rebase origin/<default>` + `git push --force-with-lease` to the cloud-agent branch.
- **Mechanical-resolution test:** post-rebase diff vs. pre-rebase diff (against the new merge base) MUST be byte-identical except inside conflict regions. Verify with `git diff <pre-rebase-tip>..HEAD -- <files-not-in-conflict>` returning empty.
- **Mechanical resolutions allowed:** alphabetical/sorted re-merge of registry append-only edits (`@descripex_modules`, plug-pipeline lists, supervisor children), test-file additions with no overlap, doc append-only blocks. Deterministic from source.
- **Forbidden:** semantic conflict resolution, any logic edit, function-body changes during rebase, any push without `--force-with-lease`, any push to a non-cloud-agent branch under this carve-out.
- **Abort path:** if mechanical resolution doesn't apply cleanly, `git rebase --abort` and post a Linear `@cursor` / `@codex` comment with conflict context. Agent picks up the rebase.

**User-confirmation gate.** `delegation-rules.md` § "DON'T AUTO-MERGE PRS" stays strict — merge-train surfaces ordered, rebase-clean PRs with the `gh pr merge` command per PR; user merges, reviewer rebases.

**When to use:**

| Situation | Use |
|---|---|
| 1 PR, critical tier | `staged-review:commit-review` |
| 1 PR, standard or ceremony | Either; merge-train is overhead-equivalent at N=1 |
| 2+ PRs, mixed tiers | **Merge-train.** Cascades, sorts, hands critical-tier off to `commit-review` inline |
| 2+ PRs, all ceremony/standard | **Merge-train.** Maximum gain — no per-PR Tier 2 cost, just cascade + user-confirm |

**Bookkeeping commits.** Post-merge ROADMAP/CHANGELOG/README updates per `staged-review:commit-review` Step 15 still happen on `main` after each PR merges. Reviewer rebases each remaining PR onto the new default tip in parallel, force-with-leases, CI re-runs.

### Issue Body = The Prompt

Same rule as `task-writing.md`: the body is for the cloud agent (and local-review session) to read and execute. Recommended sections:

```markdown
## Context
Why this exists, dependencies, what's already in place.

## Task
The thing to do, in prose. WHAT, not HOW.

## Acceptance criteria
- Bullet list a fresh QA session can verify.
- Each item is a concrete observable, not "works correctly."

## Out of scope
What this issue explicitly does NOT do.

## File paths
Anchor file:line references — reviewer's starting points.

## Scoring
[D:X/B:Y/U:Z → Eff:W] (matches ROADMAP scoring)

## Reviewer note
Anything the local-review session needs — known gotchas, prior context, env caveats.
```

`Acceptance criteria` and `Reviewer note` are what make the issue reviewable. Without them, `staged-review:commit-review` can't form a verdict.

### Code-Only PRs + Required Acceptance Criteria

**Cloud-agent PRs touch code + tests only.** They do NOT modify `ROADMAP.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `README.md`, or `.sobelow-skips`. These files are owned by `staged-review:commit-review` and updated in a single post-merge follow-up commit on `main`.

**Why:** PRs that touch shared docs hit `mergeable: CONFLICTING DIRTY` against earlier merges of the same files — every PR adds a rebase round just to resolve doc conflicts. Centralizing doc updates in one reviewer-owned commit per PR eliminates the conflict class.

**How to apply.** In the issue body's `## Out of scope`, list the files explicitly:

> Out of scope: `ROADMAP.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `README.md`, `.sobelow-skips`. Reviewer (`staged-review:commit-review`) updates these on `main` after merge.

**Required acceptance-criteria bullet** (every delegated issue's `## Acceptance criteria` MUST include this; do NOT add doc-update bullets):

- **Full harness green at PR open** — `mix format --check-formatted`, `mix compile --warnings-as-errors`, `mix credo --strict` (TODO/FIXME exit-2 carve-out only), `mix sobelow --exit Low`, `mix doctor`, `mix test.json --quiet`, `mix test.json --cover --cover-threshold N` at the repo's coverage tier, `mix dialyzer` all clean. CI runs the same checks. A red harness on PR open is a blocking acceptance-criterion miss.

`commit-review` Step 15 owns the post-merge commit: ROADMAP row marked ✅ (preserving the `[CX]` / `[CSR]` marker), CHANGELOG entry under `## [Unreleased]`, README updated if user-facing functionality changed, one commit, message `Update docs for PR #M (INE-N)`.

**`.sobelow-skips` exception:** for repos with sobelow line-fingerprint drift, the harness fails-loud-with-diff if drift is detected; commit-review applies the regen at merge in the same post-merge commit. Agent never touches the file.

### Workspace-Specific Layout

Team key, project list, repo↔project mapping, project IDs, worked examples are **workspace-specific** — they belong in:

- A separate `<workspace>-workspace.md` include (imported only by repos in that workspace's family), or
- The project-level `CLAUDE.md` of the repo(s) that need it.

**Not here.** This file documents the *shape* so any repo can adopt it. Workspace specifics rot fast.

### Delegation Eligibility Filter Order

Apply these filters **in order** when picking ROADMAP tasks to delegate. The first filter that excludes a task ends evaluation — don't argue past a hard constraint to backfill a queue (see § "Honest-Gap Discipline").

1. **Codex code-mutation suspended (workspace-wide)** → `[CX]` candidates redirect to `[CSR]`. Marker stays in ROADMAP for traceability; actual delegation goes to Cursor. Single-pass — apply once per session.
2. **Per-agent cloud-env constraints** — consult `cloud-agent-environments.md` (hex.pm, mix tasks, Tidewave, HTTP). Project-specific overrides may further exclude tools. Tasks needing unreachable tools stay LOCAL.
3. **Sibling-repo 🔶 blockers** — tasks blocked on un-released changes in a sibling repo stay 🔶. Re-check on each delegation pass.
4. **Survivors → batch candidates** — feed into § "Batch Sizing and Pacing".

### Bundled Code-Revisions in Bookkeeping Commit (Variant)

The canonical Step 14–16 sequence expects the post-merge follow-up commit on `main` to be **doc-only**. This variant uses the same skeleton with **code revisions bundled into that bookkeeping commit**, trading evaluator separation for round-trip-cost savings when push-back is high-cost / low-yield.

**When this fires.** All four conditions hold:

- PR is mostly-good but ships some dead/unwanted code that should NOT block merge.
- Reviewer's diff to remove the dead code is small (≤ a few small edits, no logic change, no behavior shift).
- Pushing back would cost more than it saves — typically because the verification the agent needs is one **its own harness can't run** (e.g. `mix dialyzer` OOMs in Cursor's cloud VM, no hex.pm in Codex Cloud, no Tidewave on Codex; Cursor reaches Tidewave so this exception is narrower than it used to be).
- The PR contains something **worth keeping** that rejecting would drop. If net-negative, close-without-merging instead.

**Shape.**

1. **Merge the PR as-is** — `gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch`.
2. **One follow-up commit on `main`** bundling: code revisions (drop dead code) + standard bookkeeping (ROADMAP row → ✅, CHANGELOG `[Unreleased]`, README/cross-ref updates if user-facing). Single commit, message: `Update docs for PR #N (INE-M) + remove dead X` so `git log --grep INE-M` surfaces the bundled scope.
3. **Linear close-out:** the closing comment **explicitly distinguishes what was merged from what was reverted, and why the agent couldn't have caught it** (env constraint — preserves no-blame framing). Flip status → `Done` manually if Linear's auto-transition didn't fire (it only fires on the merge event, not on the bookkeeping commit).

**Trade-offs.** Reviewer DOES grade the merged work this time (the trade), but against hard ground truth (dialyzer / hex / live-data) which is harder to fake. INE traceability preserved (PR # named in commit body). Touched-file scope rule applies. PR diff drift on GitHub: anyone reading `gh pr view N` sees the original diff (including dead code that no longer exists on `main`); the closing Linear comment documents the divergence. Revert atomicity: `git revert <bookkeeping-sha>` reverts both doc updates AND code revisions.

**When NOT to use.** Dead code large enough to be its own PR (push back). Agent CAN run the necessary verification (no env constraint → no excuse to skip push-back). PR is net-negative (close-without-merging). User explicitly said "always push back" in this session.

### Plan-Shaped Linear Task Specs

**Linear specs handed to cloud agents are plan-shaped, not roadmap-shaped.** Same prompt-vs-plan split as `task-writing.md`: ROADMAP rows are durable cross-instance prompts (vague enough to survive codebase changes); a Linear task delegated to a cloud agent is a single-shot consumer — same shape as a `/plan` file.

Cloud agents do NOT carry context across sessions. Each pickup is a fresh session that reads the issue body once, implements once, and stops. Roadmap-shaped vagueness — "add X to the auth module" — burns round-trips; the agent has to rediscover paths, contracts, and conventions each round.

**Template** (alongside `## Context` / `## Task` / `## Acceptance criteria`):

```markdown
## Files to modify
- `lib/foo/bar.ex` — add function `do_thing/2` with spec `(integer(), Keyword.t()) :: {:ok, term()} | {:error, atom()}`
- `test/foo/bar_test.exs` — assert success path + 2 error paths (`:invalid_input`, `:not_found`)

## Files to NOT modify
- `ROADMAP.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `README.md` (commit-review handles post-merge)
- `.sobelow-skips` (auto-regenerated; commit-review applies regen at merge)

## Env constraints
- Codex Cloud: no hex.pm, no Tidewave, no internet. Use stdlib + already-installed deps.
- Cursor Cloud: hex.pm + internet OK; mix tasks OK. Tidewave reachable via `curl localhost:<port>/tidewave/mcp` (always); native `CallMcpTool` only if Tidewave was running before session start (see `cloud-agent-environments.md` § "Tidewave on Cursor").

## Success criteria
- `mix test.json --quiet --failed` returns 0 failures on touched files
- `mix credo --strict` shows 0 issues
- `mix dialyzer` 0 warnings
- Full harness green per § "Code-Only PRs + Required Acceptance Criteria"
- PR title includes `(INE-N)`; PR opened non-draft (see § "Status Transitions")
```

The four sections (`Files to modify`, `Files to NOT modify`, `Env constraints`, `Success criteria`) are load-bearing. Skip any and the agent fills the gap with assumptions — usually wrong ones that cost a round-trip.

Before submitting a batch of N≥2 plan-shaped issues, run § "Pre-Flight Conflict Detection" — the `## Files to modify` block IS the input.

### Batch Sizing and Pacing

How to shape a delegation batch upstream of pre-flight conflict detection. Pre-flight checks file-scope collision; this section answers what should be in the batch.

**2+1+1 splits over single mega-batches.** When in doubt about whether 4-5 issues are too much, prefer two smaller batches. Smaller batches reduce review surface, reduce file-scope collision risk, let the user `/compact` between firings.

**Bundle multiple ROADMAP tasks into one Linear issue ONLY when all three hold:** shared module (single PR diff is the natural unit), same critical-tier gate (≥80% standard or ≥95% critical — don't mix), same fix shape (e.g. "add nil-guard + flunk on unexpected" applied to two functions with the same signature). If structurally different, file standalone.

**Pause for `/compact` between batches.** Each batch (2-5 issues) is the natural compact checkpoint. Surfacing the deployed batch list to the user IS the compact prompt — don't fire a second batch in the same context window.

**Parallelism.** One Cursor agent per repo at a time is fine; 4+ in flight is also fine, **IFF** each issue carries its own branch and the file-scope matrix returns no overlaps. Constraint is file-scope, not agent count.

**How to apply:**

1. Pick candidate ROADMAP tasks (after § "Delegation Eligibility Filter Order").
2. Group by shared-module + same-tier + same-fix-shape.
3. Run pre-flight conflict detection on the proposed batch.
4. If batch ≥ 4 issues, default to splitting. Surface the split shape (e.g. "2+1+1") before firing.
5. After firing, pause for `/compact` before the next batch.

### Pre-Flight Conflict Detection (Batch Delegation)

**The bottleneck.** N parallel cloud-agent PRs touching a shared coordination file (top-level registry, mix.exs, router) make every merge invalidate the others' base SHAs — delegation cost (merge lag, rebase churn) easily exceeds per-task local effort.

**The check.** Before any `mcp__linear-server__save_issue` that creates a delegated issue, scan the existing open queue + candidate set for file-overlap on coordination-tier files (consuming the `## Files to modify` block from § "Plan-Shaped Linear Task Specs"). Triggers: a batch of N≥2 candidate delegated issues being created this session, OR a single new delegated issue when ≥2 open delegated issues already exist in `Todo` / `Backlog`.

**Mechanism:**

```
filter (existing queue):
  project = <current>
  status ∈ { Todo, Backlog }
  delegate ∈ { Codex, Cursor }

then:
  parse `## Files to modify` from each issue body (existing + candidates)
  build a touch matrix: file → [issues touching it]
  classify each shared-file overlap:
    coordination-tier  if file ∈ project's coordination set
    ordinary           otherwise
```

**Coordination-tier signals** (project-overridable):

- `lib/<app>.ex` — top-level public API / registry module
- `mix.exs` — deps, version, aliases
- `config/config.exs`, `config/runtime.exs` — config registry
- `lib/<app>_web/router.ex` — Phoenix route registry
- `lib/<app>/application.ex` — supervisor children list
- Any file appearing in 3+ historical merged PRs (run `flow-stats.sh` — see § Tooling)

**Decision tree on overlap (priority order):**

1. **(a) Isomorphic tasks + shared coordination file** → recommend **bundle into 1 issue** ("annotate all N modules in one PR"). One PR, registry edited once, no fan-out.
2. **(b) Real overlap, non-isomorphic, coordination cost <30% of total task effort** → **extract a serializer issue**. Peer issues touch only their own files; the serializer (final in chain) does the registry edit and is `blockedBy` all peers.
3. **(c) Small per-task effort (<30 min) AND batch ≥4 AND any shared file** → **do locally**. Local sequential beats parallel-cloud-agent under these conditions.
4. **(d) No conflict, OR overlap only on non-coordination files** → proceed with N parallel issues.

**Worth-it heuristic.** Delegation pays when per-task effort ≥ 30 min OR batch local-effort ≥ 90 min AND tasks are independent or restructurable. Local Claude wins under any of: per-task < 30 min AND batch ≥ 4 AND any shared coordination file; OR total batch local-effort < 90 min regardless of overlap (Cursor startup + first-push round is ~10 min, so 60-min batches barely break even).

Output is **always a recommendation + decision request** — workflow surfaces the touch matrix and recommended action; user chooses bundle / serializer / local / proceed-anyway.

### ROADMAP-Fallback Flow (projects without Linear)

**ROADMAP.md is source of truth in all delegation flows; Linear is a queue *view* on top.** Projects that don't use Linear — or temporarily can't reach the Linear MCP — still run the same delegation pattern via `[CX]` / `[CSR]` markers in ROADMAP.md rows directly.

**Pickup signal without Linear:** cloud agents poll ROADMAP.md for rows with `[CX]` / `[CSR]` markers and `⬜` status (or matching their delegate field). Reviewer discovers PRs via `gh pr list --state open` filtered to cloud-agent branch prefixes (`codex/`, `cursor/`). Status updates are ROADMAP edits in the post-merge commit (Step 15 of commit-review): `🔄` → `✅` plus marker preserved.

**Changes vs Linear-backed:** no `mcp__linear-server__*` calls; skip Step 16 of commit-review. No Linear `@cursor` / `@codex` push-back channel — push-back goes on the GitHub PR review (line-level findings + scope paragraph in one PR comment), wake-mention discipline adapted to PR-only. No issue body — the ROADMAP row's prompt + the project's CLAUDE.md is the agent's full context, which pushes more weight onto plan-shaped ROADMAP rows.

**Identical:** code-only PRs, plan-shaped specs, post-merge bookkeeping commit on `main`, draft-PR handling, bot ensemble integration in commit-review Step 8.4.

Use this fallback when the project hasn't onboarded Linear, when Linear is intentionally out-of-scope, or as a safety net during MCP outages. Linear is an upgrade-path, not a hard dependency.

### Tooling

**`~/.claude/scripts/flow-stats.sh`** — reconstruct cloud-agent PR delegation-flow stats from GitHub timeline events (round count via `head_ref_force_pushed`, draft time, time-to-first-review, merge lag, reviewer breakdown).

```bash
~/.claude/scripts/flow-stats.sh <PR#> [--repo OWNER/REPO] [--json]
~/.claude/scripts/flow-stats.sh https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/pull/<PR#>
```

Auto-detects `--repo` from current git dir. Use after a cloud-agent PR merges to verify the workflow is reducing round-trips (target: 1-2 force-pushes, draft time → 0, merge lag low). Linear-side augmentation is intentionally not in the script — MCP isn't bash-callable; invoke from a Claude session and layer `mcp__linear-server__list_comments` + `get_issue` data when needed.

### Honest-Gap Discipline (Queue Dry)

**When § "Delegation Eligibility Filter Order" drains the queue to zero, surface the gap explicitly with these four paths and let the user pick. Never silently fabricate a batch from non-eligible tasks just to keep the queue full.**

The four paths:

1. **Wait** — keep the queue empty until ROADMAP gets new candidates or in-flight PRs land (often unblocks dependents).
2. **Pivot LOCAL** — pull the next-highest-Eff ROADMAP task into the local session. Often correct when filter 2 (env constraint) drained the queue.
3. **Cross-repo** — check sibling-repo ROADMAPs for delegatable tasks. The user's queue is broader than one repo.
4. **Review-mode** — switch to `staged-review:commit-review` on any in-flight cloud-agent PRs instead of opening more.

Same shape as `critical-rules.md` § "NO EVASION — SIT WITH THE HARD THING": when the easy path violates a constraint, sit with it, name it, ask. The failure mode this prevents: reaching past the eligibility filter to backfill the queue with tasks that violate filter 2 or 3 — e.g. delegating a dialyzer-required task to a cloud agent whose VM OOMs on dialyzer "because nothing else is available."

**How to apply.** After the eligibility filter, if zero tasks survive, STOP. Don't loop back to relax filter 2. Surface the gap with the four paths in one short message (one line per path). Wait for the user's pick. Don't pre-execute one as a "safe default."
