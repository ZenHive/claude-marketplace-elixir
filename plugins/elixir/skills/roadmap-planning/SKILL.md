## Task Prioritization Framework

### Scope

D/B/U scoring, status markers, and `[P]` markers apply to **ROADMAP.md and multi-task planning docs** — cross-instance coordination. **Not for `/plan` files** (single-task session blueprints). See `task-writing.md`.

### Scoring Format

`[D:X/B:Y/U:Z → Eff:W]` where `Eff = (B + U) / (2 × D)`. Scales are 1–10.

| Eff | Tier |
|-----|------|
| > 2.0 | 🎯 Exceptional ROI — do immediately |
| 1.5–2.0 | 🚀 High ROI — do soon |
| 1.0–1.5 | 📋 Good ROI — plan carefully |
| < 1.0 | ⚠️ Poor ROI — reconsider or defer |

### Scale (D / B / U)

| Value | Difficulty | Benefit | Usefulness |
|-------|------------|---------|------------|
| 1 | < 1hr, trivial | Minimal impact | Pure hygiene, invisible |
| 3 | Few hours | Minor/cosmetic | Infrastructure only |
| 5 | 1–2 days | Nice to have | Moderate unlock |
| 7 | 2–5 days | Significant QoL | Common question OR unblocks 2+ tasks |
| 9 | 1–2 weeks | Major improvement | Daily question AND unblocks 3+ tasks |
| 10 | Weeks, architectural | Transforms system | — |

**U vs B:** U captures unlock leverage, query frequency, and gap visibility. B captures impact magnitude. Infrastructure-only tasks score high D/B but low U — U prevents them from crowding out user-facing features.

### Exclusions (don't score)

🐛 bugs, 🔒 security, 📝 docs of completed work, ✅ in-progress tasks — always highest priority.

### Status Markers

- ⬜ Pending
- 🔄 In progress — include branch name (`🔄 fix/auth`)
- 🔶 Blocked/Paused
- ✅ Complete

### Pre-Implementation Gate

Before starting a code-mutating task on an existing module, confirm the module's coverage is at tier:

- ≥80% for standard business logic
- ≥95% for critical business logic (signing, money handling, cryptographic ops, low-level encoders)

If below, raising coverage is **part of this task** — not a follow-up to defer. See `critical-rules.md` § "RAISE COVERAGE BEFORE MUTATING" for scope guards (trivial doc/format/rename mutations are exempt) and the `mix test.json --cover` workflow.

### Parallel Work (`[P]`)

Mark independent tasks with `[P]`. Before starting: update status to 🔄 with branch name, commit to main, create worktree.

```
| Task 79 `[P]` | ⬜ | Independent |
| Task 80 `[P]` | ⬜ | Independent |
| Task 81 | ⬜ | Depends on 79 |
```

### Ceremony Floor — When NOT to Open a Task

**Scope:** applies to **review-surface findings** (`staged-review:commit-review`, `staged-review:code-review`). Discoveries during `/research`, `/plan`, or implementation follow the promote-to-ROADMAP rules in § Roadmap Maintenance — not this floor.

Findings during code review or PR review have a ceremony floor below which they are NEVER tracked as ROADMAP entries. ROADMAP-as-queue earns its overhead only when work spans sessions; an inline `defp` extraction does not.

| Finding shape                                         | Action                                              |
|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| ≤ 5 LOC, cosmetic / abstraction / nit                 | Push back inline OR drop — never track              |
| ≤ 5 LOC, **bug or correctness gap**                   | Push back inline — **never drop, never silently track** |
| > 5 LOC, cosmetic / abstraction / nit                 | Push back if cheap, else drop                       |
| > 5 LOC, **bug or correctness gap**                   | Push back inline                                    |
| Cross-session coordination cost (any size)            | ROADMAP candidate (e.g. public-API rename, schema migration, deprecation downstream repos must track) |
| Scope-affecting / architectural / breaks acceptance criteria | Surface for judgment (`discuss`-tier)        |

**Hard rules:**
- Bugs and correctness gaps are NEVER silently dropped, regardless of size or score. They are always pushed back inline.
- Cosmetic / abstraction findings ≤ 5 LOC are NEVER ROADMAP candidates unless they have cross-session coordination cost.
- "Drop" is permitted ONLY when the diff is genuinely better-as-is AND pushback would generate noise without value (e.g., a stylistic preference the implementing agent's choice is also defensible). When in doubt between drop and push-back, push back.
- Questions like "File a new ROADMAP task for X (single-line entry under Phase Y, scored [D:N/B:N/U:N])?" are forbidden for findings that fit the current PR — that prompt format implies the floor is broken.

**Why "correctness × size" not "D/B/U × LOC":** D/B/U scores prioritize tracked work; they don't decide whether work should be tracked. A D:1 finding can still be a real bug (3-line missing nil-check) — dropping it because the score is low is exactly the failure mode "iterate fast but error-free" forbids. Correctness vs cosmetic is the load-bearing axis; LOC is just a tiebreaker for tracking-vs-inline.

**Cross-references (delegation flows only — applies if `delegation.md` is imported):** push-back-vs-fix-locally calculus is in `linear-workflow.md` § "Push-Back-vs-Fix-Locally Matrix by Agent". Hard rule against pushing to cloud-agent branches is in `delegation-rules.md` § "NEVER PUSH TO A CLOUD-AGENT'S BRANCH".

### Task Descriptions as Prompts

Task descriptions should be prompts for Claude Code (WHAT to accomplish), not implementation specs (HOW). Let Claude research the codebase. Avoid code examples (they rot). Include success criteria. See `task-writing.md` for detail.

### Example

```
- [ ] Add WebSocket reconnection [D:3/B:9/U:9 → Eff:3.0] 🎯
      Implement automatic reconnection with exponential backoff. Include connection state tracking.

- [ ] Refactor parser modules [D:7/B:7/U:2 → Eff:0.64] ⚠️
      Consolidate duplicate parsing logic into a shared behavior.
```

### Roadmap Maintenance

**When completing a task — update ALL affected docs:**

1. **ROADMAP.md** — Mark ⬜ → ✅, update phase summary, update Current Focus
2. **CHANGELOG.md** — Add entry under `## [Unreleased]` with what + key decisions
3. **CLAUDE.md** — If repo structure/architecture/conventions changed
4. **README.md** — If user-facing features or setup changed
5. **Project-specific tracking docs** — If the task affected tracked work

A task without updated docs is incomplete.

**Archive completed tasks:** move full details to CHANGELOG.md, keep one-line reference in ROADMAP.md phase section, strike through in priority lists.

**ROADMAP structure:**
```markdown
# Project Roadmap
**Vision:** One-sentence.
**Completed work:** See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## 🎯 Current Focus
**Phase 2b: API Integration** — Fixing endpoint issues.

### 📋 Current Tasks
| Task | Status | Notes |
| Task 25 🔄 `fix/auth` | In progress | — |
| Task 26 `[P]` | ⬜ Pending | Available for parallel |

## Phase 1: Foundation ✅
> 5 tasks. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md#phase-1-foundation).

## Phase 2: Core Features
- [ ] Task 6: Add authentication [D:5/B:9/U:8 → Eff:1.7] 🚀
```

**CHANGELOG structure (anchors match phase headers):**
```markdown
## Phase 1: Foundation
### Task 1: Project Setup
**Completed** | [D:2/B:7/U:8 → Eff:3.75]
**What was done:**
- Summary of implementation
- Key decisions
```

Anchor naming: kebab-case (`#phase-1-foundation`).

**No counts or stats in entries:** no test counts, function counts, lines-changed tallies, or individual test names. Numbers rot and burn tokens. Describe *what* was built and *why*.
