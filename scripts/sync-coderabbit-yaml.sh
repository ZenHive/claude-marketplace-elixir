# Sync the canonical .coderabbit.yaml from claude-marketplace-elixir/templates/
# into the cwd (a target repo's root). Comments-only mode: no orphan autofix
# branches, no racing UTG PRs.
#
# Idempotent. Refuses to overwrite a customized local file unless --force is
# passed. The template carries a 'Synced from claude-marketplace-elixir' marker
# line; if that marker is present locally, the file is treated as previously
# synced and overwritten silently. If the marker is missing AND content
# diverges from the template, the script refuses (to avoid clobbering an
# intentional repo-specific customization).
#
# Usage:
#   ./sync-coderabbit-yaml.sh             # write .coderabbit.yaml
#   ./sync-coderabbit-yaml.sh --dry-run   # print what would be written
#   ./sync-coderabbit-yaml.sh --force     # overwrite regardless of marker
