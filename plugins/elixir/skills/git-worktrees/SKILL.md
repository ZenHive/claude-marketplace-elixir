# Worktree-Per-Branch Workflow

Run multiple Claude Code sessions in parallel without files landing on the wrong branch. The mechanic: every new branch gets its own worktree under a centralized location, named after a tracking ID, cleaned up when the work merges.

**Scope:** local laptop only — Claude Code on `~/_DATA/code/<repo>/`. Cloud-delegation worktrees (Codex `codex/...`, Cursor `cursor/...`) are governed separately by `delegation-rules.md`, `agent-dispatch.md`, and `agent-pr-review.md`.

## When to Create a Worktree

**Trigger: any branch-worthy work.** Whenever Claude would otherwise run `git checkout -b <new-branch>`, create a worktree instead.

✅ Worktree warranted:
- Starting a new feature, fix, refactor, or experiment that will become its own PR
- Working on a `[P]` parallel ROADMAP task while another session is on a different branch
- Picking up a Linear issue, ROADMAP task, or scoped fix

❌ No worktree needed:
- Tiny in-place fix on the currently checked-out branch (typo, doc tweak)
- Read-only exploration / investigation / answering questions
- Running tests, builds, or quality checks against the current state

## Naming — Use a Tracking ID

Pick the worktree ID in this preference order:

1. **Linear issue** — `MW-247`, `INE-5` (when the work is tracked in Linear)
2. **ROADMAP task number** — `task-42` (local-only work tracked in `ROADMAP.md`)
3. **Branch name** — `fix-auth-redirect`, `experiment-cache-layer` (ad-hoc work)

The ID becomes both the worktree directory name AND the branch name (or a sensible derivation — branch can be `feat/<id>-<slug>` if convention dictates).

## Location — Centralized

```
~/_DATA/worktrees/<repo>/<id>/
```

- `<repo>` = repo basename (matches `~/_DATA/code/<repo>/` directory name)
- `<id>` = the tracking ID from above

**Why centralized:** sibling-of-repo (`~/_DATA/code/<repo>-<id>/`) clutters `~/_DATA/code/`; in-repo (`<repo>/.worktrees/<id>/`) gets traversed by `ripgrep` / `mix deps` / file watchers. A dedicated top-level dir is easy to grep for orphans (`ls ~/_DATA/worktrees/<repo>/`) and stays out of every other tool's path.

## Commands

```bash
# Create — branch + worktree in one step
git worktree add ~/_DATA/worktrees/<repo>/<id> -b <branch>

# Existing branch (e.g., picking up someone else's WIP)
git worktree add ~/_DATA/worktrees/<repo>/<id> <branch>

# List active worktrees in the repo
git worktree list

# Remove (after PR merge / branch deletion on remote)
git worktree remove ~/_DATA/worktrees/<repo>/<id>
git worktree prune
```

To start working in a new worktree, open a fresh Claude Code session in that directory: `claude` from `~/_DATA/worktrees/<repo>/<id>/`.

## After PR Merge — `audit-review` Is Deferred

`staged-review:audit-review` catches hygiene drift (extractions, doc gaps, missing TODO markers, ROADMAP/CHANGELOG drift) that pre-commit `code-review` may have skipped, writes `.audit/<sha>.md` reports, and lands one `audit(...)` commit on the default branch.

**Not chained off `gh pr merge`.** The post-merge tail ends at branch cleanup. The `staged-review` plugin's SessionStart hook (`check-unaudited-commits.sh`, ≥3 unaudited threshold) surfaces accumulated tails next session:

```
/staged-review:audit-status        # read-only snapshot of unaudited commits per branch
Skill(audit-review) <range>        # batched audit over the accumulated range
```

`<range>` is typically `<last-audit-sha>..<default-branch-HEAD>` — one batched pass covers all merge SHAs since the last audit.

**Manual override:** `/audit-review [<sha>|<range>]` for catch-up audits, batch passes, or compliance asks.

**Tiny-commit fast path.** For commits ≤100 LOC AND no `lib/` (or language equivalent) touched, the skill skips Codex dispatch and writes a `verdict: clean — fast-path` report. No separate skip flag needed; if every commit in the range is fast-path-eligible, the audit is cosmetic and ends in seconds.

**Why deferred, not chained.** Bots (CodeRabbit, Copilot, Codex's GitHub bot) run between PR-open and merge, so auditing pre-bot risks re-auditing. The audit commit lands on the default branch where it's durable. Batching N merges into one pass is strictly cheaper than N synchronous passes, and `.audit/<sha>.md` artifacts indexed off merge SHAs in `main` history remain the canonical inspection surface.

## Lifecycle — Cleanup Is Part of Completion

**The work isn't done until the worktree is gone.**

Cleanup trigger: PR merged to base, or feature branch deleted from remote.

```bash
# Same session that completes the PR merge:
git worktree remove ~/_DATA/worktrees/<repo>/<id>
git worktree prune
git branch -d <branch>  # if local branch still around
```

If you forget and later notice an orphan (worktree exists, but `git branch -vv` shows the branch as merged or `[gone]`), run the same removal commands. Orphan accumulation is what motivated the original worktree ban — keeping the directory tidy is the price of admission.

## Auto-Allowed Inside a Tracked Worktree

The act of creating a worktree under `~/_DATA/worktrees/<repo>/<id>/` is itself the scope authorization for git operations on that branch:

✅ **Auto-allowed without asking:**
- `git commit` to the worktree's own branch
- `git push -u origin <branch>` to publish the feature branch
- `gh pr create` against the repo's default base branch

❌ **Still requires explicit user request:**
- Commit/push on the main checkout (`~/_DATA/code/<repo>/`) directly to a shared branch (`main`, `master`, `development`)
- Commits in dependency repos / sibling repos checked out for inspection
- `gh pr merge` (governed by `delegation-rules.md` § "DON'T AUTO-MERGE PRS")
- Force-push, amend published commits, rebase shared history
- `git push` to a cloud-agent's branch (governed by `delegation-rules.md` § "NEVER PUSH TO A CLOUD-AGENT'S BRANCH")

**Mental model:** worktree creation = scope authorization. Merge = user authorization. Three rules stay strict (merge, force-push, cloud-agent branches); commit/push/PR-create in a tracked worktree loosens.

## What NOT to Do in a Worktree

- **Don't open IEx / Tidewave from a worktree.** Use the host project (`~/_DATA/code/<repo>/`) for runtime exploration. IEx in the worktree creates a parallel `_build` and recompile churn that races with the host session. Mirrors the `agent-pr-review.md` § "Tidewave is verification, not necessarily fix" constraint.
- **Don't create a worktree for read-only exploration.** Read files in-place from the main checkout. Worktrees are for branch-worthy work that will produce commits.
- **Don't commit from a non-worktree path** (the main checkout) when the work belongs to a feature branch. If you find yourself about to `git checkout -b` from the main checkout, stop and create a worktree.

## Per-Repo Override

A project can opt out of the worktree workflow by pinning a memory file under `~/.claude/projects/<project>/memory/feedback_no_worktrees.md`. Local memory always wins over global rules. Use this only when the project genuinely requires direct work on a single shared branch (e.g. a thin extraction tool with one active line of development).
